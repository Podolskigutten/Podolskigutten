# Welcome!

My name is Lukas. I’m a master’s student in robotics at the University of Oslo.
I previously studied mechanical engineering at OsloMet and spent a year at TU Dortmund, also focusing on robotics.

This GitHub contains a mix of smaller and larger projects, ranging from control-system simulations to computer vision and robotics work. Some are completed, others are works in progress.

Feel free to explore the repositories, ask questions, or share suggestions.
